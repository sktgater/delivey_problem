Question: Delivery problem with mid-way checkpoints
Town Setting: In a 2-D Matrix
'G': goal
'X': checkpoint
'S': starting point
 0 : open block
 1 : closed block

Idea: BFS. Steps are as follow:
1. find locations of S, all checkpoints X (in a list), and goal G
2. use BFS to get shortest paths from S to each checkpoint X. Save in List.
Each checkpoint is matched under the same list index
Return -1 if not reachable
3. get shortest paths from each X to each other X
4. get shortest path from each X to the G
5. backtracking, find total shortest distance
